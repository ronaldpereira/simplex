Option Menu:
	1 - Apply the Simplex algorithm (using Bland's Law) on a Linear Programming and outputs the optimized solution or a certificate of illimitability or inviability
	2 - Given a viable and limited Linear Programming, it consults the user to use the primal or dual C-Implex implementation and outputs the solution
