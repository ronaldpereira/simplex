- Simplex algorithm implementation, using Bland's Law.
- This source code was made in C language, by efficiency reasons.
- It has two modes of executition:
  - 1 : Apply the Simplex algorithm (using Bland's Law) and outputs the optimized solution or a certificate of illimitability or inviability
  - 2 : Given a viable and limited Linear Programming, it consults the user to use the primal or dual C-Implex implementation and outputs the solution
- Matrix input format example:

```
mode 1
2
3
{{1,2,3,0},{1,1,1,2},{0,-1,3,9}}
```
